              Much has changed in the past seven months. As businesses grapple
              with the acute disruption brought on by COVID-19, the lessons of
              chronic disruption like digital transformation are proving
              useful.

            In the fall of 2019, most of us would have scoffed at anyone
            predicting that the next seven months would bring record-breaking
            unemployment levels, millions of shuttered businesses, the
            cancellation or postponement of sporting events ranging from high
            school baseball to the Boston Marathon to the Tokyo Olympics, and
            over 2 million infections and 115,000 deaths in the United States
            alone. Yet, here we are, trying to make sense of the effects of the
            COVID-19 pandemic that’s sweeping across the world.

            As companies adjust to the COVID-19 world, what are the next steps?

            To understand the unique opportunities this situation offers, it’s
            perhaps worthwhile to look at the story of a previous acute
            disruption – the 2011 Icelandic volcano eruption that shut down air
            travel across Europe for a week – and a company’s response to it. KLM
            Airlines began using Twitter to communicate with customers, since
            its call centers couldn’t handle the increased load. When the crisis
            was over, the company largely abandoned the platform and went back
            to its usual ways of working. Six months later, the CEO questioned
            why the company had done so, when it had learned to operate during
            the crisis in a way that offered so much value. KLM began investing
            in Twitter as a much bigger part of its customer service
            infrastructure. In doing so, it discovered many new challenges that
            needed to be resolved to make it effective on a permanent basis,
            such as having a multilingual staff working around the clock. Yet,
            KLM also discovered new value it hadn’t anticipated from Twitter,
            such as using the platform as a virtual lost and found to return
            items left on planes to customers after they had passed through
            security.

            We are finding two very different attitudes among companies adapting
            to the current acute disruption – those that are using this time to
            plan their place in the “next normal” and those that are treading
            water, waiting for the world to go back to what it was. We expect
            that the companies that emerge stronger from the crisis are those
            that innovate through it, using the current crisis as an opportunity
            to digitally transform their company. Fortunately, there seem to be
            more leaders in the former category than the latter. Roughly 75% of
            CEOs indicate that the crisis has created significant opportunities
            for their companies.18 In doing so, it’s important for companies to
            critically reflect on what is better about the working environment
            and what isn’t, retaining the former and abandoning the latter when
            a return to normalcy is possible.

          <p class="post__paragraph">
            The rapid shift to working from home is a good example. Many
            companies are finding that short-term individual performance hasn’t
            really dipped as a result of COVID-19, leading some companies to
            declare that employees need never return to the office again. Ben
            Waber, however, is cautious about relying on only short-term
            performance data – while Humanyze’s data shows no drop in short-term
            individual performance, the data also shows that the number of new
            or casual connections that employees interact with throughout the
            day has dropped precipitously. These types of casual relationships
            are often the source of innovation and valuable knowledge flows,
            potentially presaging the potential impact of working from home on
            the long-term performance of employees or innovativeness of
            companies. Finding ways to rekindle those serendipitous
            connections – whether through returning to in-person work or through
            creative interventions online – ay be a critical factor in measuring
            organizational health and an indicator that should be used to
            determine whether to extend the benefits of the crisis and avoid
            unintended and unforeseen outcomes.

            In the same way that a heart attack can serve as a wakeup call and
            impetus for lifestyle changes for those suffering from chronic heart
            disease, the COVID-19 crisis and other acute disruptions can serve
            as an opportunity for organizations to make some fundamental shifts
            and to implement structures and practices that will enable them to
            thrive.
